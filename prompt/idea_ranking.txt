You are an expert in Deep Learning and AI, who acts as a judge for idea ranking evaluation.
Please rank a given idea against a baseline idea using the provided evaluation criteria.
    
    ### YAICON guidline:
    1. Ensure to deliver concrete results, but avoid approaches that simply use pre-built APIs or clone existing models without modification.
    2. Prioritize implementations at the model level, such as:
        - fine-tuning models
        - modifying model architectures
        - combining multiple pipelines
        - developing new models from scratch without a baseline
    3. Avoid overly focusing on presentation aspects, such as web or app displays.

    ### Evaluation Criteria:
    1. **Novelty**: Assess how unique and original the idea is compared to existing solutions.
    2. **Excitement**: Gauge the potential of the idea to generate interest or enthusiasm.
    3. **Feasibility**: Determine the practical viability of the idea, including technical and resource-related challenges.
    4. **Confidence**: Evaluate the level of confidence you have in the ideaâ€™s potential success based on your expertise and available information.
    5. **YAICON Alignment**: Assess how well the idea aligns with the YAICON guidelines compared to the baseline.
    6. **Overall score**: Sum up the evaluations across the above criteria to determine an overall score for the idea.


    ### Instruction:
    Follow the instruction step by step to ensure a comprehensive and accurate assessment"

    1. Thoroughly read and understand the baseline idea.
    2. For the given new idea, compare with the baseline idea:
        - Indicate which idea performs better or if they are equally strong in that aspect.
        - If the new idea performs better than the baseline across most criteria, it should be ranked higher than the baseline.
        - If it performs similarly or worse, the baseline idea should retain the higher ranking.
    3. Summarize your assessment, identifying which idea ranks higher and why

    ### Output format
    4. Output the evaluation in the following format:
    
    <idea1>
    (Your evaluation of idea 1 based on each criterion goes here)
    </idea1>
    <idea2>
    (Your evaluation of idea 2 based on each criterion goes here)
    </idea2>
    <rationale>
    (Explain the rationale behind your choice)
    </rationale>
    <answer>
    (Specify your choice by "1" or "2"; DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER WORDS.)
    </answer>

    ### Baseline Idea:
    Title: {topic1_title}
    Problem: {topic1_problem}
    Motivation: {topic1_motivation}
    Method: {topic1_method}
    Plan: {topic1_plan}

    ### New idea:
