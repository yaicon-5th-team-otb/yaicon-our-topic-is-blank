This repository implements a research topic generation framework designed for YAICON, a conference organized by [YAI](<https://github.com/yonsei-YAI>) at Yonsei University. The framework was developed to help generate high-quality research topics across various AI subfields, supporting students in ideating innovative and impactful research ideas. 

It builds upon the baseline work found in [this repository](<https://github.com/NoviScl/AI-Researcher/tree/main>), which provides the foundation for generating novel research ideas using AI.

The system accepts a research domain or theme described in natural language as input and outputs a ranked list of potential project proposals. Each proposal provides a detailed research topic, enabling students to select a direction for their project with minimal additional effort.

Our agent pipeline consists of the following modules:
(1) Related Paper Retrieval;
(2) Idea Generation;
(3) Idea Deduplication;
(4) Idea Conceretization;
(5) Idea Ranking;

These modules are designed to be run sequentially as an end-to-end idea generation pipeline.

## Setup



## Related Paper Retrieval


The related work search module will iteratively propose search queries and search through the Semantic Scholar API. We then use an LLM to score the relevance of retrieved papers for reranking. The module takes a topic description or an idea as input and returns a list of the most relevant papers as output.

Example usage (finding related papers for a given topic):
```
cd ai_researcher 
bash scripts/lit_review.sh 
```

The `max_paper_bank_size` is a hyperparameter to control when to stop the paper search process (until the specified number of papers has been retrieved). The generated search queries as well as the ranked papers will be stored in the specified cache file. The cache file can be used as part of the input to the idea generation module. We used `max_paper_bank_size=120` for the experiments in our paper and used `max_paper_bank_size=50` in this demo example. Running this demo example costs $0.51. 


## Idea Generation


The idea generation module takes a topic category and a list of relevant papers as input, and returns a list of generated ideas as the output including title, problem, motivation, proposed approach, and plan.

Example usage: 
```

```


## Idea Deduplication

We do a round of deduplication to remove similar ideas generated by the grounded idea generation module.

Embed Ideas: Use all-mpnet-base-v2 to compute embeddings for all ideas.
Find Similar Pairs: Calculate cosine similarity and filter pairs (i, j) where:
  i ≠ j (different ideas).
  i ≤ N or j ≤ N (exclude previous ideas).
  Similarity > 0.75.
Remove Redundancies:
If one idea is from a previous set, remove the new idea.
If both are new, remove the idea with higher overall similarity (less novel).

Example usage:
```

```

##  Idea Conceretization


Next, we expand each seed idea into a detailed idea includng problem, motiation, proposed approach, step-by-step experiment plan, expected outcomes, and fallback plan.

Example usage:
```

```

## Idea Ranking

We rank all the generated project proposals by using an Swiss-system tournament.
The prompt includes persona assignment, YAICON guideline, evaluation criteria, instruction, and output format.

Example usage:
```

```
